# Getting started with theming

## Orchard
- [Writing a new theme] (http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Writing-a-new-theme)
- [Customizing the default theme] (http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Customizing-the-default-theme)
- [Anatomy of a theme] (http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Anatomy-of-a-theme)
- [Alternates] (http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Alternates), you'll need to know about these when building your themes ;)
- [Gallery] (http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Themes), check out how other people are doing it!

## Videos
- [Getting started with custom themes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk1iJJJ9Itg), Bertrand quietly explaining the ins and outs of theming, few out there who know Orchard better

## Paid
- [Udemy, theming for beginners] (https://www.udemy.com/orchard-cms-theme-development-for-beginners/), I haven't done this course, but it is taught by Abishev who has contributed a lot to the docs (but don't let that put you off!), so he knows his stuff
